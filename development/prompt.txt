I want you to build a very simple Spanish study app for use in the web browser of my smartphone (portrait aspect ratio). The Python code in development/example.py illustrates the logic of what the app should do: it should start by loading word-order.csv into memory when index.html loads, define some challenges, and then present those challenges one at a time, removing one when I get it right and providing hints on the third or later attempt. But instead of typing in the index number of the correct choice, there should be a grid of buttons (no index numbers shown), 2 wide and 5 tall, and my task is to press the right button. Each challenge has two parts: guessing the spelling from the audio (see audio/*.mp3) and guessing the meaning from the spelling. The multiple choice buttons should be a different color for the two rounds. The HTML version of this app should not be wordy: I'm making it for myself and I do not need instructions. Correct versus incorrect should be indicated by changing colors and a short pause: a quarter second for correct, a full second for incorrect, including a flashing indicator for the hints. I want to be able to play this quickly if all of my answers are correct, without having to wait through messaging.

The entire app should be encoded in a single file: index.html. That file should include all of the graphical elements and the Javascript, and it should not use any libraries (pure Javascript). It only needs to load word- order.csv on startup and audio files as needed. The sequence of challenges should have a clear beginning and ending; if I want to restart, I can reload the page. Put the inline Javascript near the top of the HTML so that I can edit the constants more easily in a tiny smartphone editor.
